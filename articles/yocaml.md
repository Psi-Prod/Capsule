While one might question the practical viability of a static blog generator as a
"real-world example", testing a library in a real-world context (however futile
a static blog generator may be) can quickly cover usability or restriction
issues. For example, several months after the merger of _Freer monad_ into the
main branch, [a very cute ticket](https://github.com/xvw/preface/issues/84) was
raised (fortunately, [a correction](https://github.com/xvw/preface/pull/87) has
been proposed). To avoid this kind of unforeseen problem, I decided to find a
project that covered several of the less popular and generally less understood
tools offered by Preface. Against all expectations... a static blog generator
requires many of these tools and as a future Java Champion needs to communicate,
I could ... kill two birds with one [stone](https://github.com/gr-im).

The general idea behind a static blog generator is quite easy, it is a
special case of a build system. Great, the excellent paper ["Build Systems Ã  la
Carte"](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/build-systems.pdf)
provides a formal description (and implementation paths). Although Preface had
all the necessary tools to respect the paper's implementation proposals...
well... I was not aware of its existence when writing my
implementation. That's a shame. Not being educated, I narrowed the scope of my
experiment considering, somewhat naively, that a static blog generator is
satisfied with :

- copy/paste files (for example moving a style sheet or images)
- read file
- processing file content
- writing file

Listing the actions that a generator must be able to perform, one quickly
realizes that in fact... a static blog generator can very easily be implemented
with `make` (and in addition `sed` and `awk`), but this would not really serve
the cause of Preface! Anyway, here's an example of the typical flow you'd expect
from a generator:

![Here is a flow](/images/yocaml-flow.png)

Nothing very complicated, we move the static files (here, the CSS and the
images) to the target. Then we inject the pages into the templates and move them
to the target, then we process the articles (the markdown files) and inject them
into the templates and move them, too, to the target. After all this, we can
produce an index, which will probably be injected into a template and also moved
to the target.

Now that we have the general flow of our generator, there are two considerations
I would like to add. Firstly, I would like the generator to serve several use
cases. It is therefore imperative that it not be restricted to a static file
tree (imagine I wanted to create a [cooking
blog](https://bastienduplessier.github.io/angry_cuisine_nerd/), listing recipes,
I would find it **morally unacceptable** for the recipes to be in the `articles`
directory). The second point concerns **minimality**. In other words, build only
those artifacts **that need to be built**. (Since cryptocurrency miners use
continuous integration service providers to mine bitcoin, saving computational
time to generate during the continuous integration process is a must!)

The first point is fairly easy to address, just provide the generator as a
library rather than as a binary. Backed by a rich API, a user (me) can build his
generator with flexibility and not be locked into the rigid shackles of
_convention over configuration_.

The second point is that we need to look a little more closely at the definition
of minimality.

### Minimality

Before diving into the code, it is important that we agree on the terms we will
use. As mentioned earlier, by "minimality" I mean "_the pressimistic reduction
of the operations to be performed in order to construct an artifact_". For
example, let's imagine this scenario: we have 4 files needed to produce the
`a.out` and `b.out` files. The first, `a.md` depends on `A` and the second,
`b.md` depends on `A` and `B`. Let's see what happens if we change some files in
the dependency graph. (In the example, a file that has been modified is drawn in
red):

![Minimality: scenario 2](/images/minimality2.png)

Even if everything can be a little more complicated when dynamic dependencies
are introduced (an element of the dependency graph which must be read to
calculate ad hoc dependencies, but which will not be dealt with in this article,
to avoid writing a 2000-page article), we would still like, in many cases, to
reduce the calculation graph as much as possible **when the dependencies are
known statically**.

Now that we agree on the terminology, we can go over some of the techniques used
in the development of the blog generator!

## About effect handling

When following the hype of the new generation of functional programming
languages, one is often confronted with the problem of **effects management**.
Yeah, effects are annoying because they often force the execution platform
(imagine you want to run a generator in a browser), but **effects are useful for
making useful software**.

There are **monadic effects** (or how to confine all troubles in a data of type
`IO a`), there is **algebraic effects** adjoined to **handlers**,
**user-defined-effects** (also adjoined to handlers, and generally to algebraic
effects) or **latent effects**.

OCaml, prior to [version
5](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/multicore-ocaml-september-2021-effect-handlers-will-be-in-ocaml-5-0/8554#recap-what-are-effect-handlers-1),
has a very peculiar (but very popular in the _mainstream_ language world) effect
system: **god-given effects**, which could be soberly renamed "_side effects_".
Well, since OCaml handles effects on its own, why bother trying to process them
"properly"? There are several ideological reasons which I will not detail, but
essentially "_to test the effects manager proposed by Preface_". Let me
introduce you to the **Freer Monad**!

### Describing and interpreting with Freer monad

> The difference between Free and Freer monad is quite subtle (and mainly based
> on differences in encodings and prerequisites), in use they offer similar
> capabilities. However, as Freer is significantly more efficient than Free, I
> have taken to using it exclusively. If you are familiar with Free, Freer is
> very accessible.

When writing programs that produce effects, a fairly standard technique is to
**separate the description of the program from its interpretation**. The trick
is to turn the execution of an effect into a value. We will only produce data
structures, i.e. descriptions of programs, and we can provide them with an
interpreter to concretely execute this program. Preface offers a fairly
straightforward way to build descriptions and interpreters. We start by
describing the operations that the program will be able to perform. For the
example, I propose to reason about a program that can write or read (on the
standard output) :

```ocaml
type _ operation =
  | Print : string -> unit operation
  | Read : string operation
```

And now we can build the combinators needed to describe programs by building a
Freer monad for the `operation` type:

```ocaml
module Effect = Make.Freer_monad.Over (struct
  type 'a t = 'a operation
end)
```

The construction of tools for effects management produces, among other things,
two very useful functions.

- `Effect.perform : 'a operation -> 'a Effect.t`: the ability to transform a
  constructor (from `operation`) into an effect
- `Effect.run : 'a Effect.handler -> 'a Effect.t -> 'a`: which takes an effect
  handler, a program description and runs the program.

Using the first function (`perform`) we can easily describe a program, for
example, let's just describe a program that displays `"Hello World"`, asks the
user to enter a value and displays `"Hello"` and the freshly entered value.

```ocaml
let print msg = Effect.perform (Print msg)
let read = Effect.perform Read

let program =
  let open Effect in
  let* () = print "Hello World" in
  let* name = read in
  print ("Hello " ^ name)
```

Note that the use of `let*` allows us to hide the fact that we are, in fact,
manipulating a monad and allows us to describe our program in a style close to
the direct style. Just use `let*` whenever you use a function described by the
use of `perform`. The type of our program will be `unit Effect.t` and we now
need to interpret it to give it an operational meaning. Let's write an
interpreter for our set of effects:

```ocaml
let handler : type b. (b -> 'a) -> b Effect.f -> 'a =
 fun continue -> function
  | Print message ->
    print_endline message;
    continue ()
  | Read ->
    let line = read_line () in
    continue line
```

Interpreting an effect program isn't that complicated, you need to invoke a bit
of ceremony to properly quantify the type variables (and yes, Freer uses an
[existential type](existential_java.html), which makes inferring an interpreter
impossible, hence why we should talk about
[iso-existential](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.88.778&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
rather than existential), but once our type variables are properly quantified, a
handler is nothing more than a pattern match on all the effects a program can
produce, we execute the desired action and "**continue**" the program with what
we just computed. At this stage, one can already quickly realise that it is
possible to define an interpreter/handler according to the execution context. We
could easily interpret our program in the context of the browser:

```ocaml
external console : unit -> hook Js.t = "caml_js_get_console"

let handler_js : type b. (b -> 'a) -> b Effect.f -> 'a =
 fun continue -> function
  | Print message ->
    (console ()) ## log (Js.string message)
    continue ()
  | Read ->
    let line = Dom_html.window ## prompt (Js.string "read") (Js.string "") in
    continue (Js.Opt.case (fun () -> "") Js.to_string line)
```

Yes, JS (especially in OCaml) is a bit verbose, but as you can see, you can
change the execution context without touching the original program. One slight
modification we could make to our interpreter for JavaScript would be to discard
the continuation if the return of `prompt` is empty (not filled) but let's not
dwell on the JavaScript.

Now that we have all the ingredients, we can actually run our program! And to do
this, we'll simply use the `run` function defined in the `Effect` module:

```ocaml
let () = Effect.run { handler } program
```

This section was a quick overview of effects management with Preface, there is a
[more detailed
guide](https://github.com/xvw/preface/blob/master/guides/freer_effect_handling.md)
in the Github repository which, if you are interested in the subject, I invite
you to read and if you are really interested in the subject and you, unlike me,
are able to read complicated papers, I invite you to read [_Free and Freer
Monads: Putting Monads Back into
Closet_](https://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/free-monad.html)

### Handler's composition

In the paper "[_Data Type Ã  la
Carte_](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~W.Swierstra/Publications/DataTypesALaCarte.pdf)", a
proposal of composition is given. Indeed, as in a Free monad, one builds a monad
(for free) on top of a functor, it is enough to compose functors and to build a
monad on top of the result of this composition. Although it is possible to
propose a similar encoding for Freer (where the type on which the monad is built
for free does not have to be a functor), I found it a bit verbose and boring...
My proposal (which is also verbose and boring) is to centralise the definition
of effects in a single type and to use a **phantom type** to allow only certain
types to be indexed. But to have a flexible indexing (we would like to be able
to selectively choose the effects we decide to interpret) we need to have a
minimal support of **row polymorphism**. In OCaml, a restricted form of row
polymorphism can be supported for sums by means of [polymorphic
variants](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/papers/garrigue-polymorphic_variants-ml98.pdf)
and for products by means of
[objects](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/u3-ocaml/ocaml-objects.html). In YOCaml
I used objects, but on reflection I find polymorphic variants easier to read.
Let's change our operations to add an index:

```ocaml
type ('index, 'normal_form) operation =
  | Print : string -> ([> `Print ], unit) operation
  | Read : ([> `Read ], string) operation
  | Print_foo : ([> `Print_foo ], unit) operation
  | Print_bar : ([> `Print_bar ], unit) operation
```

Even though our operations have changed, we don't need to change much in our
original handler so that it only supports `Print` and `Read`:

```ocaml
module Effect_A = Preface.Make.Freer_monad.Over (struct
  type 'a t = ([ `Print | `Read ], 'a) operation
end)

let handler_a : type b. (b -> 'a) -> b Effect_A.f -> 'a =
 fun continue -> function
  | Print message ->
    print_endline message;
    continue ()
  | Read ->
    let line = read_line () in
    continue line
```

Without going into detail, our handler which only supports the `Print` and
`Read` effects is complete, and we can now create a module for the `Print_foo`
and `Print_bar` operations and a handler:

```ocaml
module Effect_B = Make.Freer_monad.Over (struct
  type 'a t = ([ `Print_foo | `Print_bar ], 'a) operation
end)

let handler_b : type b. (b -> 'a) -> b Effect_B.f -> 'a =
 fun continue -> function
  | Print_foo ->
    print_endline "Foo";
    continue ()
  | Print_bar ->
    print_endline "bar";
    continue ()
```

And now that we have handlers for the different parts of the effects that we
would like to be able to handle independently, we can create the module and the
general handler, which handles the intersection of `Effect_A` and `Effect_B`
**by exploiting the handlers written earlier**!

```ocaml
module Full = Make.Freer_monad.Over (struct
  type 'a t = ([ `Print | `Read | `Print_foo | `Print_bar ], 'a) operation
end)

let handler : type b. (b -> 'a) -> b Full.f -> 'a =
 fun continue -> function
  | Print _ as e -> handler_a continue e
  | Read -> handler_a continue Read
  | Print_foo -> handler_b continue Print_foo
  | Print_bar -> handler_b continue Print_bar
```

Some may say that we could have compacted the implementation of our handler
composition... this is true but as each branch of the type has a different
indexing and normal form, we would have had to be tricky and the final code
would probably not have been readable.

_So far so good_, it is possible to compose handlers... is this useful in
YOCaml... **absolutely not**. I just thought it was fun to experiment with
another approach to effects handler composition which seems to be a restricted
(but simpler) version of the [`Eff`
monad](https://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/tutorial.html). OCaml making the
expression of rows simpler (_from my point of view_) than Haskell.

Now that we have described all the stuff needed to manage effects (and that
Preface offers, globally, sufficient tools), we will be able to look at the
effects described in YOCaml to provide the tools needed to build static pages.

### YOCaml effects

We've seen how to explicitly handle effects with Preface, and how,
unnecessarily, to be able to compose different handlers, now let's see what
effects we would want to propagate in a static blog generator. This is, in fact,
a slightly more comprehensive list than the one mentioned in "_What I want from
a static blog generator_", mentioned in the introduction to this article:

- we want to know if **a file exists**, if only to know whether to build an
  artifact. If it does not exist, we can guarantee that it must be created
- we want to know the **modification date** of an artifact, in fact, if an
  artifact exists, we want to know if it must be recreated (in the case of
  static dependencies)
- we would like to be able to **read a file** (i.e., pass from its name to a string
  that contains the contents of the file)
- we would also like to be able to **write files** (thanks _Captain Obvious_)
- to generalise some proccesses, we would like to be able to **list the
  children** of a directory
- for user feedback, we would like to **log information and errors**.

This list of requirements (which is a little longer in the YOCaml
implementation to handle more specific cases) can be transposed quite easily
into a list of operations (indexed or not. For code reading, and because for the
purposes of this article, we won't need to handle only certain parts of the
effects).

```ocaml
type 'a operation =
  | File_exists : filepath -> bool operation
  | Get_modification_time : filepath -> int Try.t operation
  | Read_file : filepath -> filecontent Try.t operation
  | Write_file : (filepath * filecontent) -> unit Try.t operation
  | Read_dir : (filepath * filepath predicate) -> filepath list operation
  | Log : string -> unit operation
  | Throw : Error.t -> 'a operation
```

There is not much subtlety (`Try.t` is a type that represents a valid value or
an error, it is an `Either` whose error type is fixed). Note also that the
`Read_dir` effect takes a predicate as an argument to prefilter the scanned
`children`. We can move everything into a module (`Effect` for example), build
our `Freer monad` and then implement the effect propagation combinators (so we
don't have to keep using `perform` whenever we want to propagate an effect).

```ocaml
include Make.Freer_monad.Over (struct
  type 'a t = 'a operation
end)

let file_exists path = perform (File_exists path)
let get_mtime path = perform (Get_modification_time path)
let read_file path = perform (Read_file path)
let write_file path content = perform (Write_file (path, content))
let read_dir path predicate = perform (Read_dir (path, predicate))
let log message = perform (Log message)
let throw error = perform (Throw error)
```

An interesting point of this separation between the description of the program
and its interpretation allows, for pedagogical reasons, not to worry about the
interpreter at all. Rather than showing you soporific code that manipulates the
file system, **we can assume that our handler is correctly written**, however,
for reasons of logic, we will assume that the interpretation of the `Throw`
effect will **discard the execution of the continuation**... and yes, if the code
fails, we assume that we do not want to continue.. In addition, we can very
**easily build unit tests by providing a handler** that, for example, hooks a
file system into a mutable (or not) table. From now on, we can reason about the
implementation of our blog generator without worrying about the concrete
implementation of our functions. Great, isn't it?

One might ask why some effects return `Try` values when it is possible to fail
with `throw`. This is essentially to force the fact that a function can fail
into the handler. So we can add this convenience function to our `Effect`
module:

```ocaml
 let failable eff =
    let* result = eff in
    match result with
    | Ok value -> return value
    | Error err -> throw err
```

It runs an effect that may fail, and, if it fails, catches its error and throws
it with `throw`, otherwise it returns (wrapped in an effect) the result of the
successful computation. I think this is a good way of enforcing in the handler
that a function can fail but keeping it easy to use by not requiring the use of
two levels of monads (`Effect` and `Error`).

This lengthy introduction has set out the requirements for starting to build a
flexible library in earnest. The goal was to show that **a `Freer monad` is simple
enough to use** and to lay the groundwork for building a true DSL for static page
generation. Now we can look at the generation of pages while trying to ensure
minimality.

## Characterisation of a set of dependencies

Now that we have proudly described our primary operations... our effects, we can
start looking at real problems! As mentioned in my expectations of a static blog
generator, I want **minimality**! For example, let's say I want to build an
`out` file which is the concatenation of `a.html` and `b.html`, i.e., in
bash: `cat a.html b.html > out`, or, as this diagram visually describes:

![Example of deps](/images/deps.png)

It is easy to see that the file `out` **has as dependencies** `a.html` and
`b.html`. We could imagine more complex scenarios. For example, imagine that the
concatenation of `a.html` and `b.html` could be added to a `c.html` file to
produce a new `out2` file, as in this diagram:

![Example of complexe deps](/images/deps2.png)

In this much more complicated example, we can deduce that **the dependencies of
`out` are `a.html`, `b.html` and `c.html`**. _Elementary my dear reader_. After
this huge investigation (and with a little foresight), we can deduce some rules
about how to represent our set of dependencies:

- a dependency can only be present once (yes, if `a.html` is present twice... it
  doesn't matter)
- two sets of dependencies must be combinable, to produce a new set of
  dependencies
- it is possible for a file to have no dependencies, in other words, one must be
  able to describe a set of empty dependencies

So, to recap, we are looking for "_something_" that can deal with the fact of
not having dependencies (so has a neutral element), thus describing the absence
of dependencies and that can be combined with other sets of dependencies
(producing a new set of dependencies)... **it is a monoid** ! There was quite a
clue in the chosen term "_set of dependencies_", the more seasoned private
investigators will have noticed... a `Set` of dependencies is ... a `Set` of
dependencies (e.g. of `filepath`, where `string` represents a path) and ... a
`Set` is a monoid, _elementary my dear_, where the **neutral element** is the
empty set and **the internal law of composition** (informally called "the
_oplus_ operator") is the set union.

Here is a proposal for the `Deps` module which will describe a set of
dependencies and define some useful combinators. For now, we just export the
fact that it is a
[monoid](https://ocaml-preface.github.io/preface/Preface_specs/Monoid/index.html)
(in a _Preface sense_) and provide a function to convert a list of `filepaths'
into a set of dependencies:

```ocaml
module Deps : sig
  type t

  val of_list : filepath list -> t
  val singleton : filepath -> t

  include Specs.MONOID with type t := t
end = struct
  module S = Set.Make (String)

  let of_list = S.of_list
  let singleton = S.singleton

  include Make.Monoid.Via_combine_and_neutral (struct
    type t = S.t

    let neutral = S.empty
    let combine = S.union
  end)
end

```

In this context, leaving the set of dependencies abstract allows, in the near
future, to change the representation (if, by chance, I find a better
representation one day). Now that we have a fairly naive definition of a set of
dependencies, we can implement **useful** combinators!

### Interweaving of dependencies and effects

Now that we have a robust representation of a set of dependencies (or, at best,
an abstract, hence substitutable, representation), we can tackle the
exploitation of our effects to answer a fundamental question in the generation
of a static blog: "**_should an artifact be rebuilt or not?_**" To answer this
very complicated question, we must first solve this very complicated _equation
system_:

- if the artifact does not exist, **it must be constructed**
- If the artifact exists, mind you, here's the complicated maths, is its
  modification date greater than all the modification dates of the dependencies?
  (In other words, is the modification date of the artifact greater than the
  largest date of the dependencies). **If yes, then the artifact should not be
  rebuilt, otherwise it should be rebuilt**

We know how to get the modification date of a file, just use `Effect.(failable (get_mtime file))`
but how do we handle a list (for dependencies)? In general,
when you want to apply an operation on a list, you use `map`. The problem is
that here, applying `failable . get_mtime` with `map` will give us a list of
`int Effect.t` which is not very practical to use... Fortunately, when one does
not know how to solve a problem in functional programming, there is a canonical
answer: "**_it is traverse_**". And in this case, is **sequence**, which is a
special case of _traverse_... so it is indeed traverse. In practical terms,
`Traversable` allows us to switch from a list of effects to a list effect.
First, let's define a traversable list of effects, and then a function which
takes a list of `filepath` and returns an effect which contains the list of
`mtime`:

```ocaml
module Traverse = List.Monad.Traversable (Effect)

let get_mtimes list =
  List.map Effect.(fun file -> failable (get_mtime file)) list
  |> Traverse.sequence
```

Great! We now have a function of type `filepath list -> int list Effect.t` and
we can use it to implement the `Deps.need_update` function in accordance with
the very complicated equation system mentioned above! As we have implemented all
the requirements previously, the implementation of `need_update` is fairly
trivial.

```ocaml
let need_update deps target =
  let open Effect in
  let* exists = file_exists target in
  if exists
  then
    let* target_time = failable (get_mtime target) in
    let+ deps_times = get_mtimes (S.elements deps) in
    List.exists (fun deps_time -> deps_time > target_time) deps_times
  else return true
```

Everything seems to be going well! We have all the plumbing for "_doing things_"
by means of the `Effect` module and now we can describe sets of dependencies and
check that an artifact is to be built (and ensure minimality). Now we need to
build an API (or DSL) to provide the opportunity to build artifacts.

## Definition of building rules

> (after an extraordinarily irrelevant introduction)..

The crux of the problem in a static site generator is ... generally, to **write
files that are the composition of several files**. For example, let's imagine a
minimalist blog, here is how we would like to create an article (without any
consideration of effect management, think of it as pseudo-code):

```ocaml
let create_article file =
  let content = read_file file in
  Markdown.from_text content in
  |> inject_into "templates/article.tpl.html"
  |> inject_into "templates/layout.tpl.html"
  |> write_file ~into:"articles/" (change_extension file "html")
```

If we invoke `create_article "my_first_post.md"` we can make a first
observation. The target is `articles/my_first_post.html` and the dependencies
are `my_first_post.md`, `templates/article.tpl.html` and
`templates/layout.html`. In the current form, it is not possible to do static
analysis properly. However, the example captures an interesting insight, each
step must describe dependencies. Let's start with the generator atom, reading a
file.

To begin, we will define a type that will describe **an action attached to
dependencies**. It is a kind of function, which produces an effect (and yes,
we'll probably have to tinker with the file system) and which is attached to a
set of dependencies.

```ocaml
type ('a, 'b) t =
  { deps : Deps.t
  ; task : 'a -> 'b Effect.t
  }
```

The advantage of this type is that it is easy to guess how to use it to create a
file. Here is a proposal:

```ocaml
let create_file target { deps; task } =
  let open Effect in
  let* need_update = Deps.need_update deps target in
  if need_update
  then
    let* () = log "need to be created" in
    let* content = task () in
    failable (write_file target content)
  else log "nothing to do"
```

This function has the type `filepath -> (unit, string) t -> unit Effect.t`.
Specifically, it takes a path (the file we want to create), and a value of the
type we have previously defined and **if the file is to be created, it writes
it, otherwise it does nothing**. Now that we can create files... let's implement
a first action (a value of type `('a, 'b) t` to **read a file**. reading a file
**generates only one dependency, the file to be read**:

```ocaml
let read_file file =
  { deps = Deps.singleton file
  ; task = (fun () -> Effect.(failable (read_file file)))
  }
```

The type of `read_file` is `filepath -> (unit, string) t`. Perfect! This is just
the type we need to test our `create_file` function!

```ocaml
let rule = create_file "my_page.html" (
  read_file "my_page.markdown"
)
```

Here, our variable `rule` has the type `unit Effect.t`, so in order to performs
the file generation it is necessary to **interpret it**, exactly as we saw
previously.

```ocaml
Effect.run { handler = my_handler } rule
```

We can read the contents of a file and write it elsewhere, but we would like to
be able to apply a transformation to the contents of the file. For example, we
would like to be able to transform the content of our file (which seems to be
written in Markdown, given its extension) into HTML. As long as we have a
function that transforms Markdown into HTML, writing the action that
takes care of it seems quite trivial. As the action must act on content that has
already been read, we know that the action will have no dependency, we can
therefore use **the neutral element of our monoid as a dependency**.

```ocaml
let process_markdown =
  { deps = Deps.neutral
  ; task = (fun x -> Effect.return (Markdown.to_html x))
  }
```

Let's have fun seeing that **we can, in fact, lift any unary function into an
action**! And yes, a function (which for example acts on strings) will have no
dependencies (so it's just the neutral element of our monoid) and
`Effect.return` allows to promote any regular value in a value wrapped in an
effect! See how to refactor our action:

```ocaml
let lift f = {
  deps = Deps.neutral;
  task = (fun x -> Effect.return (f x))
}
let process_markdown = lift Markdown.to_html
let roaring = lift String.uppercase_ascii
```

As I have a lot of humor, I added `roaring` which allows to **ROAR a text**
(transform its content into uppercase). But hey, okay, we can create actions,
but don't you notice a little problem? How to connect `read_file` with` process_markdown`?
Right now ... we can't really ... AHAHA.

### Compose our actions together

You can proudly create actions but you can't connect them... that's sad! Let's
see how to solve this very difficult problem. Let's proceed step by step!
Composing the dependencies is pretty straightforward... and yes, **I insisted
like a moron that the dependencies form a monoid**, so their composition is
already present in their API: `Deps.combine deps_a deps_b`. Concerning the
composition of the tasks, it is a bit more boring... what we would like is a
function like this: `('b -> 'c Effect.t) -> ('a -> 'b Effect.t) -> 'a -> 'c Effect.t`.
We should be able to get away with something like this:

```ocaml
let compose a b =
  let open Effect in
  let deps = Deps.combine a.deps b.deps in
  let task x =
    let* f = b.task x in
    a.task f
  in
  { deps; task }
```

Ok, it works... but ... does the signature of the composition of the tasks
remind you of something? Ahah excellent, indeed, the signature corresponds
exactly to the **composition of Kleisli**! So rather than bother with complex
considerations and unintuitive use of `bind`, let's use `<=<`!

```ocaml
let compose a b =
  let open Effect in
  let deps = Deps.combine a.deps b.deps in
  let task = a.task <=< b.task in
  { deps; task }
```

This is very cool, and what a coincidence, the **Kleisli composition** allows us
to compose **Kleisli arrows** (yes, `'a -> 'b Effect.t` is a [Klesli
arrow](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Kleisli+category)). Great, now we have a
very unpleasant way to compose several actions!

```ocaml
let rule =
  create_file
    "my_page.html"
    (compose (read_file "my_page.markdown") process_markdown)
```

When you only compose two actions, the boring aspect of the function is not felt
too much, but as soon as you decide to compose more actions... **the pain is felt**,
**like when you dip your lips in a too hot tea**.

```ocaml
let rule =
  create_file
    "my_page.html"
    (compose
       (read_file "my_page.markdown")
       (compose
          process_markdown
          (compose
             roaring
             (compose
                roaring
                (compose roaring
                   (compose roaring
                      (compose roaring roaring)))))))
```

Yes, I know... I'm abusing, I'm shamefully taking advantage of the fact that the
extraordinary `roaring` is idempotent to propose a not very credible example of
what I call the **compose-hell**! and I'm a schemer at heart, so my tolerance to
docked brackets should be battle tested! Fortunately, in the same way that
JavaScript escaped from the Callback-hell using the `then` method, we'll be able
to get away with defining ... **an operator**!

```ocaml
let ( >>> ) = compose

let rule =
  create_file
    "my_page.html"
    (read_file "my_page.markdown"
    >>> process_markdown
    >>> roaring
    >>> roaring
    >>> roaring
    >>> roaring)
```

The stairway to hell has been fixed with an operator and it is interesting to
see that we are faced with a kind of composition of _things that look like
functions_. However, not all our problems are solved. Indeed, as **the function
that produces the action to be executed is buried in a type**, interacting with
it is complicated. And so how to facilitate interactions between actions?
_Muehehe_ nothing easier, **just add combinators and operators**! Fortunately,
there is an abstraction that captures the derivation of these combinators and
operators!

### Enter the Arrow

To simplify interactions with actions (our famous `('a, 'b) t` type), it is
necessary to construct complementary operators and combinators. Fortunately,
much of the work has already been done in the previous section! As for monads
(or applicatives), **it is enough to implement minimal functions to derive a
succession of useful combinators**! In fact, our `compose` function, backed by
an `id` value (of type `('a, 'a) t`) is captured by an abstraction called
[`Category`](https://ocaml-preface.github.io/preface/Preface_specs/Category/index.html)
and which provides all the composition operators. As we have already implemented
`compose`, all that remains is to implement `id`, and its implementation is easy
to guess. We want to use the two neutral elements of the two monoids that
characterise an action (and yes, `task` is a monad which is ... _a monoid in the
category of endofunctors... what's the problem_):

```ocaml
  module Category = Make.Category.Via_id_and_compose (struct
    type nonrec ('a, 'b) t = ('a, 'b) t

    let id = { deps = Deps.neutral; task = Effect.return }

    let compose a b =
      let deps = Deps.combine a.deps b.deps in
      let task = Effect.(a.task <=< b.task) in
      { deps; task }
  end)
```

We don't gain much compared to what we already had, it's just that we leave the
generation of operators to Preface. The only concrete gain we have is the `<<<`
operator, which is the reverse version of `>>>`. The only real point of
describing `Category` is that it is needed to build
[`Arrow`](https://ocaml-preface.github.io/preface/Preface_specs/Arrow/index.html),
which builds on top of `Category`. There are several ways to describe `Arrow`
but the one we are going to use requires, in addition to `Category`, an `arrow`
function which is in fact exactly the `lift` function we implemented earlier and
which lifts an arbitrary function into an arrow and a `fst` function. The `fst`
function may seem a bit strange at first (and we'll describe it in more detail
later), but its purpose is to transform a `('a, 'b) t` value into `('a * 'c, 'b * 'c) t`.
**It transforms the input of the function into a pair, applies the
task to the first element of the pair and returns the application of the task
coupled with the second element of the input pair which will not have changed**.
Although at first glance this function may seem completely useless, we will see
that it is in fact very practical!

Here is an implementation of `Arrow` for our actions. In addition to building
the `Arrow` module, I have included it in the rules module so that the
combinators are present in the module's toplevel. I did not do this for
`Category` as its combinators are included in `Arrow`:

```ocaml
module Arrow =
    Make.Arrow.Over_category_and_via_arrow_and_fst
      (Category)
      (struct
        type nonrec ('a, 'b) t = ('a, 'b) t

        let arrow f =
          { deps = Deps.neutral;
            task = (fun x -> Effect.return (f x)) }

        let fst a =
          let open Effect in
          { deps = a.deps
          ; task = (fun (x, y) -> let+ r = a.task x in  r, y)
          }
      end)

include (Arrow : Preface.Specs.ARROW
    with type ('a, 'b) t := ('a, 'b) t)
```

And... it was here that the Romans clashed... `Arrow` provides a plethora of
combinators/operators. To understand their interest, I will try to explain them in
as much detail as possible! _Stay tuned_.

### Arrow (and Category) functions

As mentioned earlier, our `('a, 'b) t` type is a kind of function. However,
since the function that corresponds to the action that needs to be performed is
buried in a record, composing it and interacting with it is a bit complicated,
plus we have to keep in mind to capture the dependencies intelligently every
time. Fortunately, we have derived a set of utility functions so that we don't
have to worry about these details, but since in the type `('a, 'b) t`, `a` is in
**contravariant** position and `b` is in **covariant** position, understanding
the type signatures of the combinators derived by Arrow's generation can be
tricky. So I propose to go through them one by one and understand their
respective usefulness.

#### `>>>` (a.k.a compose)

We have already observed that `>>>` corresponds to the composition of Arrows.
Suppose I have two arrows: `f` and `g`, of type `('a, 'b) t` and `('b, 'c) t`
respectively, then `f >>> g` produces a new arrow of type `('a, 'c) t`. **This
is function composition (from left to right) generalized to arrows**.
Concretely, the composition of arrow, in our context, will create a new arrow
with as dependency, the union of `f` and `g` and the composition of kleisli of
the task of `f` and the task of `g`.

![arrow compose](/images/arrow-compose.png)

If we reduced our arrows to functions, ignoring dependencies and effect, which
is convenient because functions are also arrows (`type ('a, 'b) t = ('a -> 'b)`), `>>>`
could be verbosely written in this way:

```ocaml
let (>>>) f g = fun x ->
   let y = f x in
   g y
```

The cool thing is that we had to code the operator by hand, to provide
`Category`, and this is probably the most useful operator, it will allow
sequencing each operation. To use the example in pseudocode we gave:

```ocaml
let create_article file =
  let content = read_file file in
  Markdown.from_text content in
  |> inject_into "templates/article.tpl.html"
  |> inject_into "templates/layout.tpl.html"
  |> write_file ~into:"articles/" (change_extension file "html")
```

Assuming that each operation (`read_file`, `Markdown.from_text` and
`inject_into`) has an arrow, we don't need `write_file` because we had already
defined the `create_file` function, it could be reformulated as follows:

```ocaml
val read_file : filepath -> (unit, string) t
val process_markdown : (string, string) t
val inject_into : filepath -> (string, string) t

let create_article file =
  let target = Filename.concat "articles" (change_extension file "html") in
  create_file target (
    read_file file
    >>> process_markdown
    >>> inject_into "templates/articles.tpl.html"
    >>> inject_into "templates/layout.tpl.html"
  )
```

We have seen that compose takes two arrows, and like any composition operator,
there is its flipped version: `f <<< g = g >>> f` however, I have found fewer
use cases, I find the order of execution unnatural.

The composition **composes two arrows**, but we have seen that `arrow` can
promote a unary function to arrow, so there are combinators that shorten the
composition of arrow with regular functions:

- `f >>^ g` = `f >>> (arrow g)`
- `f ^>> g` = `(arrow f) >>> g`

Which, assuming our `Markdown.from_text` function is a `string -> string`
function, we could rewrite our previous example like this:

```ocaml
let create_article file =
  let target = Filename.concat "articles" (change_extension file "html") in
  create_file target (
    read_file file
    >>^ Markdown.from_text
    >>> inject_into "templates/articles.tpl.html"
    >>> inject_into "templates/layout.tpl.html"
  )
```

And as with all composition operations, there are flipped versions which we
won't go into because I guess you get the idea. Keep in mind **that the hardest
part of this part has been done**, `>>>` is really the core of the pipeline
definition and the rest is just a bonus! Youhou.

#### `fst`, producing arrows with more than one parameter

Having seen how to sequence arrows, let's now look at the second of Arrow's
prerequisites, `fst`. In the context of `compose`, we were constructing new
arrows by sequencing. `fst` allows us to **construct a new arrow that will wait
for two parameters (in the form of a pair) and we return a pair where the first
element is the application of the arrow on the first element of the pair and the
second element of the pair is unchanged**:

![arrow fst](/images/arrow-fst.png)

Just as with `compose`, let's abstract away the capture of dependencies and the
effect to see what `fst` would look like in the context of functions:

```ocaml
let fst f = fun (a, b) ->
  (f a, b)
```

To understand its use, let's imagine we have a `read_file_with_metadata`
function which assumes that when we read a file, we return a `string * metadata option`
pair. It's quite common to attach metadata to a document, and we'd like
to be able to read the document and its metadata, so what could be more relevant
than to return a pair with the contents of the document and its potential
metadata? However, the problem is that our markdown arrow will no longer be
valid because at the reading stage, we no longer return a string, but a pair
with a string and optional metadata. We would like to be able to process the
markdown only on the first element of the pair. Aha, that's a good thing, we
have a combinator to do just that! (We can also assume that `inject_into` takes
a string and metadata pair (because the metadata is probably useful for building
the layout) and returns a pair with the injected content and propagates the
metadata.)

```ocaml
let create_article file =
  let target = Filename.concat "articles" (change_extension file "html") in
  create_file target (
    read_file_with_metadata file
    >>> fst process_markdown
    >>> inject_into "templates/articles.tpl.html"
    >>> inject_into "templates/layout.tpl.html"
    >>^ Stdlib.fst
  )
```

The last line of our arrow (`>>^ Stdlib.fst`) is necessary because the
`create_file` function takes a target and an arrow of type `(unit, string) t`.
So once we have processed our file, we can discard its metadata. Now that we
have seen `fst`, it is very easy to guess what the next one will be... `snd`!

#### `snd`, producing arrows with more than one parameter (_bis repetita_)

No need to elaborate, `snd` is strictly analogous to `fst`, **it just leaves the
first parameter of the pair unchanged and applies the function to the second**. In
the same way as `fst` we go from an arrow waiting for an input to an arrow
waiting for a pair.

![arrow snd](/images/arrow-snd.png)

As with `fst`, it is fairly easy to give the implementation in the function
arrow (ignoring dependencies and effect) and the implementation, unsurprisingly,
does not vary much from `fst`:

```ocaml
let snd f = fun (a, b) ->
  (a, f b)
```

At this point, one could imagine... a `fst_of_three` or `third_of_fifty`
combinator (lol) but, in fact, **`fst` and `snd` are enough**. And yes, in the
same way that a pair allows you to describe three pieces of data: `(a, (b, c))`
(yes, that's roughly how a list is described: `type 'a list = (unit, 'a list) Either.t`)
you can describe three-parameter input arrows in this way: `('a * ('b * 'c), 'd) t`.
**Which brings us to the major problem of the arrows!** They
imply an infamous way of programming and encourage the use of the horrible
"point-free-style" (or [Tacit
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming)... thanks
[APL](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)>), a great
language that can sometimes tend to be unreadable, a bit like Perl in fact).
Although Tacit programming can quickly give the impression that the person who
wrote it is brilliant, let's face it, it can quickly become unreadable.
Fortunately, in the generation of a static blog, **one rarely needs anything
that is not sequentially describable**, which generally does not involve too
much functional witchcraft.

But enough of this, let's take a quick look at two last operators, which can
sometimes be useful.

#### `***` (a.k.a split)

Thanks to `fst` we can produce, from an arrow that goes from `a` to `b`, a new
arrow that goes from a pair of `a` and `c` and produces a pair of `b` and `c`,
and thanks to `snd` we can produce, from an arrow that goes from `a` to `b`, a
new arrow that goes from a pair of `c` and `a` and produces a pair of `c` and
`b`, **so from an arrow that goes from `a` to `b` and an arrow that goes from `c`
to `d`, I could produce an arrow that goes from a pair of `a` and `c` to a pair
that goes from `b` and `d`** in this way: `fst a >>> snd b`. So here is `split`
(`***`) which is a shortened form of the successive sequence of `fst` and `snd`:

![arrow split](/images/arrow-split.png)

And as with our previous operators, we can implement split for the arrow
function, ignoring dependencies and effects, other than by using `fst` and `snd`
(already given above):

```ocaml
let ( *** ) f g  = fun (a, b) ->
   (f a, g b)
```

And life is about equivalence, and we have seen that `split` can be expressed in
terms of `compose`, `fst` and `snd`. Well, we can express `fst` and `snd` in
terms of `split`!

```ocaml
let fst f = f *** id
let snd f = id *** f
```

Here the `id` is not the identity function but the `id` defined in `Category`,
well... in the case of arrow functions... `fun x -> x` (i.e. the identity
function) is the implementation of `id` (as `Category`).

Now that we have a way to reduce the complexity of our workflows by merging
mergeable operations, thus avoiding the need to sequence successions of `fst`,
`compose` and `snd`, we can turn our attention to the final combinator that I
will introduce in this article!

#### `&&&` (a.k.a fan-out)

Our last operator allows us to apply two arrows to two elements. Another common
operation that could be considered would be to apply two arrows to a single
value. **So for two arrows from `a` to `b` and from `a` to `c`, produce a new
arrow that goes from `a` to a pair of `b` and `c`**. Or apply two arrows to the
same parameter simultaneously. Thinking only in terms of `fst` and `snd` we
could imagine implementing this function like this:
`(fun x -> (x, x)) ^>> fst f >>> snd g`. So here is `fan-out` (`&&&`) which is,
like `split` a shortened of `fst` and `snd`.

![arrow fan-out](/images/arrow-fanout.png)

Without the ceremony of dependencies and effects, the arrow function that
corresponds to this operation is, once again, quite easy to
reason about:

```ocaml
let (&&&) f g = fun x ->
  (f x, g x)
```

Here are the operators and functions that can be used in regular arrows to build
more complex arrows by assembly. Before drawing a conclusion of the exploitation
of arrows, I would like to present you a small example of use.

### Piping files using arrows

> As I'm already up to my neck in shame, I'm stealing another example from
> [Xavier](http://xvw.github.io/talks/lambdalille-kotlin-arrow/support.pdf) (but
> which he took directly from the YOCaml code, so my honour is "a little bit
> safe")

The scenario is quite simple, we would like to be able to concatenate files, for
example, to implement this case, or concatenate the files `header.html`,
`article.html` and `footer.html` to build the file `_build/article.html`:

```make
article.html: pages/%.html header.html footer.html
  cat header.html article.html footer.html > _build/article.html
```

Having already the arrow `read_file` (`string -> (unit, string) t`) there is a
tempting approach to use `&&`, which we have just seen!

```ocaml
let concat_files file_a file_b =
  read_file file_a &&& read_file file_b
  >>^ (fun (content_a, content_b) -> content_a ^ content_b)
```

If the previous sections have been well understood, this code should
not be a problem. `read_file` is a function which returns an arrow which expects
`unit` as an argument, so we produce a global arrow which expects `unit` which
we pass to the arrows produced by `read_file file_a` and `read_file file_b`,
giving us a pair of the contents of `file_a` and `file_b` and then one promotes
a regular function which simply concatenates two strings. If you are a hipster,
you can rephrase this implementation as _tacit_ (point-free for the win) **and be
hated by your coworkers** (but by feeling _smart_, which is not to be overlooked):

```ocaml
open Preface

let concat_files file_a file_b =
  read_file file_a &&& read_file file_b
  >>^ Pair.uncurry ( ^ )
```

_So far so good_ we now have a function of type `filepath -> filepath -> (unit, filecontent) t`.
Cool, let's try to implement our example in `Make`:

```ocaml
concat_files "header.html" "article.html" &&& read_file "footer.html"
>>^ Pair.uncurry ( ^ )
```

**Damn**, _what a mess_! The type of our arrow gives us an indication that
`concat_files` is not very exploitable: `(unit, filecontent) t`. What we would like
is something like that:

```ocaml
read_file "header.html"
>>> pipe_content "article.html"
>>> pipe_content "footer.html"
```

Type of `pipe_content` is fairly easy to infer: `filepath -> (filecontent, filecontent) t`.
As a starting point, we have the `read_file` arrow which starts
from `unit` and returns `a file content`. So as `pipe_content` takes a file
content and returns a file content, so we can focus on reading the file. As we
saw earlier, we have a `filecontent`, and we would like a pair of
`filecontents`, the second being the result of reading the file. We have a file
content, unfortunately, `read_file` returns an arrow waiting for `unit`. One
possible solution is:

![arrow pipe](/images/arrow-pipe.png)

At this stage, we have our couple and we can just concatenate them!

```ocaml
let pipe_content filename =
  (fun x -> x, ())
  ^>> snd (read_file filename)
  >>^ (fun (content_a, content_b) -> content_a ^ content_b)
```

Unlike our first implementation, `pipe_content` is no longer restricted because
its type is `filename -> (filecontent, filecontent) t`.
The use of `snd` reinforces the idea that new arrows are being built.

### Some closing words on our Arrow

After a first glance, one could quickly say **that one of the most atrocious
ways of programming has been highlighted**! Replacing all function calls with
Arrow pipelines is a very bad idea that forces _tacit_ programming. How
horrible! On the other hand, like the operators of Applicatives and monads (and
many others), one can **add context** to a computation-sequence. Browsing
through the various Arrows operators showed us the building blocks needed to
construct **sequential pipelines** to which we added dependency capture and
(almost transparent) effect propagation. And, not covered in this article, it is
possible to capture other pervasive idioms in a language. For example,
[conditional
jumps](https://ocaml-preface.github.io/preface/Preface_specs/Arrow_choice/index.html).

The main lesson about using arrows could be summarized into three doctoral assertions:

- Arrow allows to extend some primitive construction into and unreadable block
- but it add context (and it can be useful, for example, for defining a static
  blog generator)
- having, like [in Idris](https://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/syntax.html)
  syntax extension, could be nice (`let operators` are not sufficient for arrow syntax).

The usage of Arrow for a static blog generator is not new, it is even **a rather
obsolete way** of doing it. [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), prior to
version 4, used dependency capture logic incredibly similar to that of YOCaml,
funny! Hakyll decided to use a monadic construction to simplify the DSL. Since there
is no real YOCaml-user, I will may be not facing this problem. _Ahah_.
But it was all I want say about designing a DSL for creating generators. Joint with
a good API, difficulties behind Arrows can be hidden. But it can be cool to
understand what is under the hood. Let's move on the last _big part_ of this too long
article.

## It is all about diversity

We have _proudly_ designing, using Arrows, an almost-generic way to build generics
(_modulo the expressivity of our standard library_) pipelines. We **provide a kind
of abstraction over effect handling (so also over the excution platform) and a kind
of abstraction over sequential computation**. But now, we will abstract over other
things:

- the Markup language (Markdown, Org, AsciiDoc, etc.)
- the Metadata language ([Yaml](https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-yaml),
  S-Expression, Toml, Ini, etc.)
- the Template Engine (like
  [Mustache](https://github.com/rgrinberg/ocaml-mustache))

Abstracting over the markup language is not very complicated... it just a
function from `string` (our `filecontent`) to `filecontent Try.t` (`Try.t` is a
biased version of `('a, 'b) result`, where all potentials errors are known). But
abstracting over metadata and template engine is more complicated and pretty
orthogonal. So here is a naive implementation (mainly written by
[Pierre](https://github.com/gr-im)) that is a _almost smart usage_ of **visitor
pattern** (as an aspirant Java Champion, I had to use almost one Design Pattern)
, **existential types, applicative validation and boilerplate**. Let's imagine
this flow:

![Tpl flow](/images/yocaml-tpl-flow.png)

Our `a.md` file looks like this:

```markdown
---
title: I'm an article
date: 2021-11-12
author: The XHTMLBoy
---

Hello, **this is a first article in Markdown**.
```

I want, after reading, to have a pair of `strings`, the first element is the
text between the `---` and the second is the text after the second `---`. For
the content (the second element) I can just apply a function that transforms the
markdown into HTML and it's done. But for the metadata (the first element of the
pair) I have to do:

- Transform the text into Yaml (or other meta format I have chosen)
- validate the Yaml data to project it into a concrete OCaml type, here it might
  be: `type article_meta = {title: string; date: Date.t; author: string option}`.
- Once our data are in the right type (and validated) we have to project it in a
  format understandable by the template engine
- Then we can finally inject them into the templates at the same time as the
  content.

At this level, we quickly realise that the Markup language has little influence
on the overall flow but that the template engine and metadata format impose
anchor points for abstraction. (Hence the need for an intermediate type. One can
only worry about having a function of `MyMetaLanguage.t -> my_metadata` and
having `my_metadata -> MyTemplateEngineMetaData.t` to be able to connect the
metadata to the template... **through the magic of transitivity**).

However, before going from our metaformat to our type which describes our
metadata, we need to be able to transform a string into our format (for example
Yaml). Ie: a module of this type:

```ocaml
module type READABLE = sig
  type t
  val from_string : string -> t Validate.t
end
```

Now we need to describe **format-agnostic** validators.

### Metadata Validation Ã  La Carte using Applicative functors and Visitor Pattern

The fact that we would like to use the `Validation` applicative is quite
obvious, we want **to collect all the errors in the metadata and not have to run
the generator X times to catch X errors**. So we know we'll be using
`Validation`, which is fairly well documented in [this
guide](https://github.com/xvw/preface/blob/master/guides/error_handling.md#parallel-validation).
But if I decide to use TOML instead of YAML, I have to rewrite all of my
metadata, ok, but it would be a shame if I had to rewrite my validation
functions. _No problemo_, **let's abstract over the notion of key-value!** _So
far so good_ let's read the pattern bible again: [**Design Patterns: Elements
of Reusable Object-Oriented
Software**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns).

Our goal is to describe what the components of a key-value representation are
(which could, for example, at least represent JSON). And provide a fold function
for each case. This gives us a rather naive version of the visitor! For YOCaml,
we assumed that elements describing key-value structures could be `integers`,
`floats`, `booleans`, `strings`, `null` values (because ... JSON), `lists` or
`objects`.

```ocaml
type ('a, 'b, 'c) visitor = ('b -> 'c) -> (unit -> 'c) -> 'a -> 'c

module type VALIDABLE = sig
  type t

  val as_object : (t, (string * t) list, 'a) visitor
  val as_list : (t, t list, 'a) visitor
  val as_string : (t, string, 'a) visitor
  val as_boolean : (t, bool, 'a) visitor
  val as_integer : (t, int, 'a) visitor
  val as_float : (t, float, 'a) visitor
  val as_null : (t, unit, 'a) visitor
end
```

Our visitor type, ie: `as_integer f g obj`, can be read as: if `obj` is readable
as an integer, extract the integer in `x` and apply `f x`, otherwise, apply `g ()`.
With the `VALIDABLE` interface you can generate `validators`. Here is the
API of what I guess as sufficient for validating complex metadata. Firstly,
simple validators are described. Visitors that simply wait for a value of the
correct form.

```ocaml
type t

val object_ : t -> (string * t) list Validate.t
val list : t -> t list Validate.t
val string : t -> string Validate.t
val boolean : t -> bool Validate.t
val integer : t -> int Validate.t
val float : t -> float Validate.t
val text : t -> string Validate.t
val null : t -> unit Validate.t
```

Then, we can describe visitors that validate the correct form and then apply an
additional validator (for example, to force a string to have a minimum number of
characters, or to constrain the number of elements in a list):

```ocaml
val object_and : ((string * t) list -> 'a Validate.t) -> t -> 'a Validate.t
val list_and : (t list -> 'a Validate.t) -> t -> 'a Validate.t
val list_of : (t -> 'a Validate.t) -> t -> 'a list Validate.t
val string_and : (string -> 'a Validate.t) -> t -> 'a Validate.t
val boolean_and : (bool -> 'a Validate.t) -> t -> 'a Validate.t
val integer_and : (int -> 'a Validate.t) -> t -> 'a Validate.t
val float_and : (float -> 'a Validate.t) -> t -> 'a Validate.t
val null_and : (unit -> 'a Validate.t) -> t -> 'a Validate.t
```

Now we can deal with the objects, by processing their fields:

```ocaml
val optional_field
    :  ?case_sensitive:bool
    -> (t -> 'a Validate.t)
    -> string
    -> t
    -> 'a option Validate.t

  val optional_field_or
    :  ?case_sensitive:bool
    -> default:'a
    -> (t -> 'a Validate.t)
    -> string
    -> t
    -> 'a Validate.t

  val required_field
    :  ?case_sensitive:bool
    -> (t -> 'a Validate.t)
    -> string
    -> t
    -> 'a Validate.t
```

The interesting point is that, if we provide a `VALIDABLE` (i.e. the short list
of visitors), we can describe the complex set of validations just listed. For
example, here are some example implementations (the others are easy enough to
guess):

```ocaml
module Make_validator (KV: VALIDABLE) = struct

  let string_and additional_validator =
    KV.as_string additional_validator (fun () ->
        Validate.error $ Error.Invalid_field "String expected")

  let string = string_and Validate.valid

  let optional_aux kind case_sensitive validator k s =
    Option.fold
      ~none:(Validate.valid None)
      ~some:(fun x -> null_and (fun () -> Validate.valid None) x <|> validator x)
      (find_assoc ~case_sensitive k s)

  let optional_field ?(case_sensitive = false) validator k s =
    object_ s
    >>= optional_aux
      "field" case_sensitive (map Option.some % validator) k

  let optional_field_or ?(case_sensitive = false) ~default validator k s =
    optional_field ~case_sensitive validator k s
    >|= Option.value ~default

  let required_field ?(case_sensitive = false) validator key subject =
    optional_field ~case_sensitive validator key subject
    >>= Option.fold
          ~none:Error.(to_validate (Missing_field key))
          ~some:Validate.valid
end
```

Yes, this code may seem complicated, but the big advantage is that it is totally
hidden to the user! Let's say I want to build a validator for Yaml, here is the
[representation of
Yaml](http://anil-code.recoil.org/ocaml-yaml/yaml/Yaml/index.html#types) in its
OCaml library:

```ocaml
type value = [
| `Null
| `Bool of bool
| `Float of float
| `String of string
| `A of value list
| `O of (string * value) list
]
```

It is incredibly easy to describe a validator! Well, I grant you that it is a
bit boring, but at least the lack of difficulty gives credit to the previous
code!

```ocaml
module Yaml_validator = Make_validator (struct
  type t =
    [ `Null
    | `Bool of bool
    | `Float of float
    | `String of string
    | `A of t list
    | `O of (string * t) list
    ]

  let as_object valid invalid = function
    | `O kv -> valid kv
    | _ -> invalid ()

  let as_list valid invalid = function
    | `A v -> valid v
    | _ -> invalid ()

  let as_string valid invalid = function
    | `String s -> valid s
    | _ -> invalid ()

  (* etc. *)

  let as_null valid invalid = function
    | `Null -> valid ()
    | _ -> invalid ()
end)

```

We have proceeded in exactly the same way as in the previous sections. We
describe some boring code "_as a library producer_" to make it easier for the
user to use "_the library as a consumer_". To move on to the next step, we need
a first ingredient: a function that separates the content of a document from its
metadata: `filecontent -> (string option * filecontent)`, this function is not
very interesting but it will extract the bounded content in the `---` and the
content after the metadata description. The metadata is described as potentially
absent (hence the option) because it is conceivable that a document has no
metadata.

Now we can extend our `READABLE` module by saying that `READABLE` data is also
validatable by injecting a `VALIDATOR`:

```ocaml
module type READABLE = sig
  type t
  include VALIDATOR with type t := t
  val from_string : string -> t Validate.t
end
```

The `READABLE` module is able to transform a string into our metaformat and
provides a minimal validation API. Now we need to be able to actually define a
validation scheme for data. We can add a new module which will project our
metaformat into a metadata type using the `READABLE` combinators to provide
validation:

```ocaml
module type PROJECTABLE = sig
  type t
  val from_string : (module READABLE) -> string option -> t Validate.t
end
```

The purpose of this `from_string` function is to start with our metadata option
and use an `READABLE` module given as an argument to validate the data and
concretise our metaformat into metadata. For example, let's implement the
metadata of an article as shown in our example:

```ocaml
module Article = struct
  type t = {
    title: string
  ; date: Date.t
  ; author: string option
  }

  let make_metadata title date author =
    {title; date; author}

  let from_string (module R: READABLE) = function
    | None -> Validate.error (Error.Required_metadata [ "Article" ])
    | Some str ->
      R.from_string str >>= R.object_and (fun obj ->
        make_metadata
        <$> R.(required_field string) "title" obj
        <*> R.(required_field Date.validator) "date" obj
        <*> R.(optional_field string) "author" obj
end
```

If you are not familiar with **applicative validation**, I invite you to re-read
the [Preface
guide](https://github.com/xvw/preface/blob/master/guides/error_handling.md#parallel-validation).
The good thing is that thanks to our visitor-derived validation, we can write
validation schemes that don't care about the metaformat. For example, ensuring
that a string is an email address, or that a list is non-empty. The use of
`Date.validator` (the implementation of which is not given) indicates that we
can correctly compose our validators. All for the best!

Now let's package everything in an arrow to facilitate the use of our
reader/validator on demand:

```ocaml
let read_file_with_metadata
    (type a) (module R: READABLE) (module P: PROJECTABLE) filepath =
    read_file filepath
    >>^ split_metadata
    >>> fst (arrow (P.from_string (module R)))
    >>> (lift_task (function
          | Valid x -> Effect.return x
          | Invalid x -> Effect.throw (Error.of_list x)))

```

`lift_task` has type `('a -> 'b Effect.t) -> ('a, 'b) t`. This is a bit like
`arrow` except that the function returns an effect. The type of our
`read_file_with_metadata` arrow is :

```ocaml
val read_file_with_metadata
  :  (module READABLE)
  -> (module PROJECTABLE with type t = 'a)
  -> filepath
  -> (unit, 'a * string) t
```

After running our arrow, we have a pair with our **correctly parsed metadata**
as the first element and the content of our document unchanged as the second.
The interesting thing about this approach is that it makes `Article` (the
description of our metadata) completely format-agnostic. Everything is
abstracted using the READABLE module. We could simplify our code by providing,
in the modules that describe our metaformat, for example in `Yocaml_yaml` an
arrow that avoids having to give two modules (we suppose that `Readable` is
defined in `Yocaml_yaml` and contains the `Yaml_validator` we defined earlier
and the function `from_string`, _of course_):

```ocaml
let read_file_with_metadata
    (type a) (module P : Yocaml.PROJECTABLE with type t = a) filepath
  = Yocaml.read_file_with_metadata (module Readable) (module P) path
```

Great, we have the **generic projection** (i.e. reading text data, and
validating it) defined. Now to deal with the various template engines, we would
need the **generic injection**, which is the transformation into a format
interpretable by a template engine.

### Metadata injection Ã  La Carte, without any fancy trick

As most of the work has been done before, one must sadly note that the injection
is super easy and **does not rely on any complicated Java Champion
techniques**... We only have to provide the opposite of our visitors. Instead of
"visiting cases", **we provide combinators to produce cases**.

```ocaml
module type DESCRIBABLE = sig
  type t

  val object_ : (string * t) list -> t
  val list : t list -> t
  val string : string -> t
  val boolean : bool -> t
  val integer : int -> t
  val float : float -> t
  val null : t
end
```

And, for example, for Yaml, you can provide a descriptor very simply by reusing
the type of `Yaml_validator`:

```ocaml
module Yaml_descriptor = struct
  type t = Yaml_validator.t

  let object_ list = `O list
  let list list = `A list
  let string str = `String str
  let boolean b = `Bool b
  let integer i = `Float (float_of_int i)
  let float f = `Float f
  let null = `Null
end
```

Now, as we have described what readable metadata is. We need to describe what is
injectable metadata. Nothing could be simpler! Instead of having `from_string`
we need a `inject` function. That function will take a `t` describes it as
a list of key attached to values `DESCRIBABLE`.

```ocaml
module type INJECTABLE = sig
  type t
  val inject :
    (module DESCRIBABLE with type t = 'a) -> t -> (string * 'a) list
end
```

We can easily improve our `Article` module to describe the metadata :

```ocaml
module Article = struct
  type t = {
    title: string
  ; date: Date.t
  ; author: string option
  }

  let make_metadata title date author =
    {title; date; author}

  let from_string (module R: READABLE) = function
    | None -> Validate.error (Error.Required_metadata [ "Article" ])
    | Some str ->
      R.from_string str >>= R.object_and (fun obj ->
        make_metadata
        <$> R.(required_field string) "title" obj
        <*> R.(required_field Date.validator) "date" obj
        <*> R.(optional_field string) "author" obj

  let inject
    (type a) (module D: DESCRIBABLE with type t = a) {title; date; author} =
    [ "title", D.string title
    ; "date", D.object_ (Date.inject (module D) date)
    ; "author", Option.fold ~none:D.null ~some:D.string author ]
end
```

By **structural subtyping, which applies to modules**, `Article` can be
interpreted as a `PROJECTABLE` and a `INJECTABLE`! And as before, for
`READABLE`, we would like to be able to project our injectable data into the
format of our template engine, so we can add a `RENDERABLE` module whose purpose
is to inject our data into a template engine:

```ocaml
module type RENDERABLE = sig
  type t
  include DESCRIBABLE with type t := t
  val to_string : (string * t) list -> filecontent -> filecontent
end
```

Let's package everything in an arrow!

```ocaml
let apply_as_template
  (type a) (module I: INJECTABLE) (module R: RENDERABLE) template_file =
  let action ((meta, content), tpl_content) =
    let data = I.inject (module R) meta in
    let variables = ("body", R.string content) :: values in
    R.to_string variables tpl_content
  (fun x -> x, ())
  ^>> snd (read_file template_file)
  >>^ action
```

The first observation is that we use the same trick as for `piped_content` **to
avoid locking up our arrow and make it composable** (i.e. applying
`apply_as_template` several times to get a hierarchy of templates. The second
observation is that **the content of the file is added as data to be injected
into the template** to allow the user to arbitrarily choose where to inject the
content. The type of our `apply_as_template` arrow is :

```ocaml
val apply_as_template
  :  (INJECTABLE with type t = 'a)
  -> (RENDERABLE)
  -> filepath
  -> ('a * string, 'a * string) t
```

For a pair of (injectable) metadata and file content, it returns the unchanged
metadata and the modified file content (injected into the template). As for
reading metadata, an arrow can be described in the package of a template engine,
for example Mustache, to reduce the number of modules to provide (we suppose that `Renderable` is
defined in `Yocaml_mustache` and contains the `Yaml_descriptor` we defined earlier
and the function `to_string`, _of course_):

```ocaml
let apply_as_template
    (type a) (module I : Yocaml.INJECTABLE with type t = a) template
  = Yocaml.apply_as_template (module I) (module Renderable) template
```

That's it! We can now propose a task that creates articles by correctly
extracting the metadata and correctly injecting it into a template!

```ocaml
module Metadata = Yocaml_yaml
module Template = Yocaml_mustache

let create_article file =
  let target = Filename.concat "articles" (change_extension file "html") in
  create_file target (
    Metadata.read_file_with_metadata (module Article) file
    >>> snd Markdown.to_html
    >>> Template.apply_as_template (module Article) "templates/article.html"
    >>^ Stdlib.snd
  )
```

The symmetry between reading data and injecting it into a template is fun, and
now we have a generic approach to building static, relatively configurable page
generators. **We can finally conclude**!

## The belated conclusion

In this article, we have briefly seen some of the details of how **an aspiring
Java Champion** uses a library to generate, _unproductively_, his blog, through
three axes:

- How to abstract over effects using **Freer monad** and handlers (in \__Javaist_ words
  "_how to use hexagonal architecture_ via "_the interpreter pattern_")
- How to capture dependencies between tasks using **Kleisli Arrow** (and `Set`)
- How to deal with metadata, _at user level_ (in _Javaist_ words "_how to deal
  with visitors and subtyping_")

There are still several aspects that I haven't covered (so as not to make this
article too long), such as **how to deal with dynamic dependencies**, but
perhaps that will be the subject of a future article. To conclude, Preface is
pretty cool to use and you can try your hand at using
[YOCaml](https://github.com/xhtmlboi/yocaml) (if you like OCaml). There are
several examples that can be used as a reference:

- [The examples folder](https://github.com/xhtmlboi/yocaml/tree/main/examples)
  that is almost covered in the
  [tutorial](https://yocaml.github.io/doc/yocaml/index.html)
- [My blog](https://github.com/xhtmlboi/blogger)
- [Angry Cuisine Nerd](https://github.com/BastienDuplessier/angry_cuisine_nerd)
  a recipe blog by [Zangther](https://github.com/BastienDuplessier) that use
  YOCaml in an unconventional way
- [LambdaLille History](https://github.com/lambdalille/history) that tracks the
  [history of Lambda Lille](https://github.com/lambdalille/talks) by
  [xvw](https://github.com/xvw) that deal with dynamic deps.

In addition, YOCaml [has several
plugins](https://github.com/xhtmlboi/yocaml/tree/main/lib). In particular, one
that allows you to directly generate pages in an [Irmin](https://irmin.io/)
storage, which can therefore be served by a [MirageOS
unikernel](https://mirage.io/).

It was quite different from the previous articles because it was:

- a little less technical than usual
- almost no Java (sorry)
- a bit promotional

I hope you found it interesting to read and I'll see you soon for new articles!
