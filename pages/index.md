Hello, you are on my personal web page. I am passionate about computer
development and this site/blog will serve as a space to document my
attempts to become a **Java Champion** or **Google Developer
Expert**. Apart from software design and (valid) XHTML, I have a
particular passion for everything related to the concept of
"**muscles**". I love *muscular people*.
